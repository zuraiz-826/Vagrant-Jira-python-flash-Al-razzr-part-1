Lab Name: 10. Serving Static Files
Objectives:

Understand the concept of serving static files in web applications.
Learn how to configure a web server to serve static content.
Implement serving static files using a simple web application.
Test and verify that static files load correctly in the browser.
Prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Familiarity with Python and Flask framework (or any web framework).
Installed environment for local web development, preferably Python 3 and Flask.
Lab Tasks:

Task 1: Setting Up the Project
1.1 Create Project Directory
Create a new directory for your project:

mkdir static-files-lab
cd static-files-lab
Create a virtual environment for the project:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Flask in the virtual environment:

pip install Flask
1.2 Initialize the Flask Application
Create a app.py file with the basic Flask application setup:
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Task 2: Creating Static Files
2.1 Create the Static Directory
Create a directory named static inside your project:

mkdir static
Within the static directory, create a CSS file:

styles.css
body {
    background-color: #f0f8ff;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}
2.2 Set Up Templates Directory
Create a directory named templates in the project root.
Create an HTML template, index.html, in the templates directory:
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Static Files</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Static Files Lab</h1>
</body>
</html>
Task 3: Running the Application
3.1 Test the Application
Ensure your environment is activated and run the Flask application:

flask run
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Verify that the page loads successfully and the stylesheet is applied.

Conclusion
Upon completion of this lab, you now understand how to serve static files in a Flask application. You configured the application to deliver static content, which is fundamental for any web application to enhance user interface with CSS and JavaScript.

By serving static files, you ensure your web applications are not only functional but also visually appealing and interactive. This basic setup provides a foundation for more advanced web application features, such as optimizing file delivery and implementing content delivery networks (CDNs).

Note: The same concepts apply to other web frameworks. Explore and experiment with serving static files using Django, Express, or any other framework of your choice for a broader understanding.
