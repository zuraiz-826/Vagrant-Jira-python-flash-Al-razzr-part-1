Lab Name: Session Usage in Flask
Objectives
Understand the concept and importance of session management in web applications.
Learn how to configure sessions using Flask's session mechanism.
Implement session data storage and retrieval in a Flask application.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python programming.
Familiarity with Flask basics.
Flask environment set up on your local machine.
Tools Required
Python 3.x
Flask
Lab Tasks
Task 1: Set Up Flask Application
Install Flask:

Ensure Flask is installed. If not, install Flask using pip:
pip install Flask
Create a Flask Project:

Set up a new directory for the Flask project.
Create a Basic Flask App:

Inside your project directory, create a file named app.py and add the following code:
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Welcome to Flask Session Lab'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Task 2: Configure Sessions in Flask
Set a SECRET_KEY:
Modify app.py to include a secret key for session management. This is crucial for securely signing the session cookies.
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'
Key Concept: The SECRET_KEY is used to cryptographically sign the session data. Ensure it's a strong, random key and kept secret.
Task 3: Store Data in Session
Set a Session Value:

Within app.py, add a route that sets a session value. In this case, we'll set the username.
from flask import session

@app.route('/set_session')
def set_session():
    session['username'] = 'Alice'
    return 'Session data set'
Explanation:

The session object in Flask acts like a dictionary, allowing you to store data across requests.
Task 4: Retrieve and Display Session Data
Retrieve and Display Session Value:

Add a route that retrieves and displays the stored session value.
@app.route('/get_session')
def get_session():
    username = session.get('username', None)
    return f'Logged in as {username}' if username else 'Not logged in'
Explanation:

The session.get method safely retrieves the session value, returning None if the key does not exist.
Conclusion
In this lab, you learned how to implement session management in a Flask application. You configured a SECRET_KEY for session security, stored data in sessions, and retrieved it across different routes. This basic implementation can be expanded for various use cases where maintaining user state is essential, such as login systems or personalized user experiences.

Key Concepts Recap:
Session Management: Vital for web applications to maintain user state information across HTTP requests.
SECRET_KEY: Essential for securing session data via cryptographic signing.
Case Study Example: Consider a web application requiring users to log in. Session management allows you to remember logged-in users' information, enhancing user experience by not requiring them to log in repeatedly as they navigate through the site.
