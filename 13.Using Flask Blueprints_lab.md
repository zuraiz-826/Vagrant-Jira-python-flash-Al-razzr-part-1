Lab Name: 13. Using Flask Blueprints
Objectives:
Understand the purpose and benefits of using Flask Blueprints.
Learn how to create and register a Blueprint in a Flask application.
Develop skills to organize routes using Blueprints in a Flask project.
Prerequisites:
Basic understanding of Python.
Familiarity with Flask and its structure.
Flask installed in your working environment.
Lab Tasks:
Set Up the Flask Project Environment

Create a new directory for your project.
Initialize a virtual environment and install Flask.
Create the Flask Application Structure

Set up the main application file (app.py).
Create a blueprints/ directory to organize your Blueprints.
Define a Flask Blueprint

Inside the blueprints/ folder, create users.py.
Define a Blueprint in users.py and create basic routes.
Register the Blueprint in the Main Application

Import and register the users Blueprint in app.py.
Run the Application and Verify Routes

Execute the application and verify that Blueprint routes are accessible.
Task 1: Set Up the Flask Project Environment
Step 1: Create a project directory and navigate into it.

mkdir flask_blueprints_lab
cd flask_blueprints_lab
Step 2: Set up a virtual environment.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Step 3: Install Flask.

pip install Flask
Task 2: Create the Flask Application Structure
Step 1: Create the main application file.

Create a file named app.py in the root of your project directory.
# app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
Step 2: Create a blueprints directory.

mkdir blueprints
Task 3: Define a Flask Blueprint
Step 1: Inside the blueprints folder, create users.py.

Add the following code to define the users Blueprint.
# blueprints/users.py
from flask import Blueprint

users_bp = Blueprint('users', __name__)

@users_bp.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def list_users():
    return "List of users"

@users_bp.route('/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user(user_id):
    return f"Details of user {user_id}"
Key Concepts:

Blueprint: A way to organize routes and handlers in a modular fashion in Flask applications, aiding in scalability and maintainability.
Task 4: Register the Blueprint in the Main Application
Step 1: Import users Blueprint in app.py and register it.

# app.py
from flask import Flask
from blueprints.users import users_bp

app = Flask(__name__)

# Register the users Blueprint
app.register_blueprint(users_bp)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
Technical Term:

Blueprint Registration - Integrating the defined Blueprint into the main Flask app to include its routes.
Task 5: Run the Application and Verify Routes
Step 1: Run the Flask application.

flask run
Step 2: Verify the Blueprint routes by accessing them in your web browser:

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/users to see the list of users.
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/1 to see the details of user with ID 1.
Example:
Testing the routes ensures that they are correctly set up and the Blueprint is properly registered and functional.

Conclusion:
By completing this lab, you have learned to compartmentalize your Flask application's components using Blueprints, enabling better organization and easier scalability. This structure facilitates collaboration in larger projects by making sections modular and independent.
