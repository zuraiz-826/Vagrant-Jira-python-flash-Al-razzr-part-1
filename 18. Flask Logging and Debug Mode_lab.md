Lab: Flask Logging and Debug Mode
Objectives
Understand the purpose of logging and the debug mode in Flask applications.
Learn how to enable and use debug mode in Flask to aid development.
Implement basic logging to monitor and troubleshoot Flask applications.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python and Flask framework.
Python and Flask installed on your system.
A code editor like VSCode or PyCharm.
Introduction
When developing web applications using Flask, monitoring what the application is doing behind the scenes and finding bugs effectively is crucial. Logging allows developers to see messages about how their code is executed, and debug mode helps in spotting and diagnosing errors with detailed error messages.

Tasks
Task 1: Setting Up Flask Application
Create a new Flask application:
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to Flask Logging Example"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
Key Concept: Flask is a microframework which is easy to set up and provides great flexibility for web applications.
Task 2: Enabling Debug Mode
Enable debug mode:

Debug mode helps catch errors by providing detailed error messages.
Update the app.run() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Verify debug mode:

Run your Flask application and introduce an error, such as by changing the route function name that is unimplemented.
Check the console to see detailed error messages.
Task 3: Implementing Basic Logging
Inside a route, insert a logging statement:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    app.logger.info("Home route has been accessed.")
    return "Welcome to Flask Logging Example"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Explanation:

Logging Level: app.logger.info is used to informationally log messages that can be used to understand the flow of the application.
Case Study:

Most applications use a similar approach to log specific events, which significantly aids troubleshooting when they occur.
Verify logging:

Run the application and access the home route to see the log message displayed in the console.
Conclusion
Logging is an essential aspect of application development and helps in monitoring application behavior and diagnosing issues.
Debug mode is invaluable during development as it provides insight into errors with stack traces.
Both logging and debug mode are cost-effective tools to increase your productivity and code reliability in a Flask application.
In this lab, you've set up a simple Flask application with basic logging and debug mode. These tools are pivotal in developing robust, maintainable, and debug-friendly web applications.
