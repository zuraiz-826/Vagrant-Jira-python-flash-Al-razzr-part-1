Lab 8: Using url_for and Redirects
Objectives
Understand how to navigate web applications seamlessly using url_for.
Learn how to implement redirects in a web application.
Comprehend the importance of URL routing in Flask.
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python programming.
Familiarity with Flask web framework.
Have Flask installed in your Python environment.
Lab Tasks
Task 1: Define Routes in a Flask Application
Create a New Flask Application

Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project:
mkdir flask_lab
cd flask_lab
Initialize a new virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Flask in your virtual environment:
pip install Flask
Setup the Basic Flask Application Structure

Create a file named app.py in your project directory.
Add the following code to app.py:
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/home')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Home Page!"

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    return "Please Login Here!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Task 2: Implement url_for and Redirects
Use url_for for Routing URLs

url_for is a function that helps in generating URLs dynamically based on the name of the function. It is useful for referencing other parts of the application without using hard-coded URLs.
Implement Redirect Logic

In app.py, update the /login route to redirect to the /home route using url_for and redirect:
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/home')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Home Page!"

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    # Redirecting to the home page
    return redirect(url_for('home'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Task 3: Test Redirection
Run the Flask Application

Ensure your virtual environment is active and then run the application:
python app.py
Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/login. You should be automatically redirected to the home page, which confirms the proper implementation of redirect and url_for.
Conclusion
In this lab, you have learned how to define multiple routes in a Flask application, utilize url_for to dynamically generate URLs within your app, and implement redirects effectively. These are foundational skills for building structured and intuitive web applications using Flask.

By mastering these concepts, you enhance your ability to manage URL routing efficiently, thus contributing to a more maintainable and scalable codebase.
